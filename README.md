This project is our submission to the [Plotly Autumn App Challange](https://community.plotly.com/t/autumn-app-challenge/87373). The corresponding web app can be viewed [here](https://dolphin-app-2hxot.ondigitalocean.app/).

## Key Features

The key focus of this web application is to allows users to dive into the world of Michelin star restaurants and to discover places based on their preferences and interest. Do you want to get an overview of all Green Star restaurants? No Problem. Interested in all restaurants that offer a vegetarian menu? Say no more. Or maybe you feel fancy and want to see all three-start restaurants that also have an interesting wine list? We got you covered.

To allow for this high level of customizability, we have implemented the following key features in the app:

### Overview
The map is the central component of this application. It displays all restaurants that are part of the guide michelin and allows users to roam around the globe and find places that they are interested in.

### Filters
Through the filters, users are enabled to customize the map along their preferences. That way they can mix and match what they want to see and tailor their experience to their liking.

### Tooltips
By hovering over a restaurant, the user can easily get the most basic information about that place.

### Profile View
If users want to get more information than what they can get via the tooltips, the can simply click on the restaurant and view the restaurant profile box. Interested in even more information? Simly click on one of the buttons and view the restaurant on the Guide Michelin website or on the dedicated restaurant home page.

### Dashboard
If a user is interested in an entire area rather than a single restaurant, they can click on the dashboard button. As a result, a dashboard is shown based on all restaurants in view. Note that only those restaurants end up in the dashboard that remain after applying the filters. That way, a whole array of dashboard experiences is possible, such as a dashboard of Japan, a dashboard of two-start restaurants, or a dashboard of wheelchair accessible restaurants, just to name a few. The "Locations" as well as the "Location x Cuisine" charts on the dashboard furthermore adjust based on how many restaurants are in view.

### List
If the user prefers to scroll through the restaurants in view, they have the option to click on the restaurant list button. This gives them a paginated list with all restaurants in view, sorted by their number of Michelin stars. Additionally, clicking on a restaurant focusses that restaurant on the map.
